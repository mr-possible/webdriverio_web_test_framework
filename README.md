# WebDriverIO Test Automation Framework (Mocha + Typescript)

## Steps to run the suite (local machine):

1. Run `npm install`. This will make sure the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` are generated, indicating successful download of dependencies for the project.

2. Run `Env=qa npm run wdio`. You can also give either `dev` or `prod` urls. I have anyways kept same url for all the environments for demonstration purposes.
